### Abstract
(Write a short abstract of three sentences. Your abstract should summarize your entire project, but only the very most important aspects. Here are two examples of how you might structure your abstract: (1) "Our main question is .... This question is important because .... To address the question, we will ...." and (2) "We are concerned with ..., because .... To address this concern, we plan to ....")

### Keywords
Tax Returns and Income Distribution

### Introduction
Briefly introduce your project. (About 150 words.)

### Problem Domain
(Use short sub-sections to describe your topic and the setting (that is, the sociotechnical situation), including project framing, human values, direct and indirect stakeholders, possible harms and benefits. See the Design Brief, section B.3. Note: You must include three citations to related work (URLs to similar work, high quality articles from the popular press, reseach papers, etc. ). You may find it helpful to include a figure. (About 400 words.))

### Research Questions
**What is the distribution of income over the United States based on Zip Code and State?**
We want to explore if there are certain states that have more concentrated wealth. This can show income inequality in the US. It is important for understanding which areas need the most financial subsidies and government assistance.

**Does wealth distribution change based on tax laws in different states?**
It may seem intuitive that states with lower personal income tax should have wealthier individuals. People pay less tax, and high earners may be attracted to live in these states. Does this assumption hold true? Or are there other forces at work that are worth exploring?

(Present your 3-5 research questions. You should present each research question. For each research question, you should discuss why it is important and what motivates the question. (About 50 words for each question, so for four questions you would write about 200 words or more if needed.))

### The Dataset
The data we are choosing to use is from the US Government, specifically the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The data is called "Individual Income Tax Statistics" from 2019. This contains information on tax filings, income, returns, loans, deductions, and other monetary observations. It effectively has all the information input on a tax return. This data is grouped by zip code, and there is a separate file for each state in the US. This dataset provides all the information to understand the fiscal landscape of the US based on geographical location. This will help us uncover the factors contributing to wealth inequalities in the US.

((1) Describe how your dataset is related to your problem domain and, specifically, to your research questions. That is, how will your dataset enable you to answer your research questions? (2) Include a table that presents the name of each data file, the number of observations (rows), and the number of variables (columns). (3) Include a full citation to each data file, including URL. (4) Finally, describe the provenance of your dataset, addressing such key questions as: (a) Who collected the data? When? For what purpose? (b) How was the data collection effort funded? Who is likely to benefit from the data or make money? (c) How was the data validated and held secure? Is it credible and trustworthy? (d) How did you obtain the data? Do you credit the source of the data? (About 400 words.))

### Expected Implications
(Proposal only. Assuming you answer your research questions, briefly describe the expected or possible implications for technologists, designers, and policymakers. (About 150 words.))

### Limitations
(Proposal only. What limitations might you need to address? Briefly discuss. (About 150 words.))

### Acknowledgements (optional)
(Is there anyone you would like to thank? A librarian who helped you with your research? A Teaching Assistant? A friend who helped you find your data? Say thank you in this section.)

### References
(Include your three or more research citations here. Also, include citations to your data files. Please use a standard citation style of your choice. See [Citing Sources](https://guides.lib.uw.edu/research/citations) at the UW Library.)
